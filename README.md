HeadFirst
=========

I love using the HeadFirst books by O'Reilly when I'm trying to learn
a new language. They're just right to work with my ADHD. Here I'll keep
track of the various examples and samples that I've gone through.

Here are the books that I have gone through so far:

1. HeadFirst Python - Don't recall where I put all these
2. HeadFirst PHP & MySQL - Don't recall where I put all these
3. HeadFirst C (in progress) - starting this repo with this book
